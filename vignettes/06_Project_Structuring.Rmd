## To be completed in lieu of class 10/10/22

For your final project in this class, you will be developing an R package. For all participants in this class, this R package will contain:

+ A function to clean some data of your choice
+ A function to somehow manipulate, subset, or transform data
+ A statistical function (ANOVA, LM, other of your choosing)
+ A function that plots data

For graduate students and H-Option students, you will also include two other functions of your choosing.


This week, you will begin this, in earnest. In the YourLastname_pkg, in your R folder, choose one of the above functions. Write it. Add, commit, and push it to GitHub.
